# Poli_-flat_file-generation

In the first delivery, the shared repository is expected to have the classes and methods necessary in an Eclipse project, to generate flat files like those that the main problem of the project would receive as input. That is, this delivery consists of designing and implementing a program that, when run, generates a series of files that serve as input to the program that will organize the data. The first installment is, then, basically the design and implementation of the GenerateInfoFiles class.

For the development of this part of the program, there are 3 input files, the methods for reading and creating output files are implemented, which are created within a folder named outputFiles

The first installment of this project was developed in Java with Apache NetBeans IDE 17
