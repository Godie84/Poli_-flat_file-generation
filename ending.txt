What was learned during development:

Learning about file manipulation in Java:
Through this project, I gained experience in reading and writing files in Java using the File classes,
BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, FileReader and FileWriter. I understood how to work with different types of files and
handle exceptions related to file operations.

Working with collections and data flows:
I used collections like List to store information about products
and sellers, and learned how to manipulate this data efficiently using loops and collection methods in Java.
I also practiced using data streams to read and write information sequentially.

Random data generation: I implemented random sales generation, which allowed me to practice generating
of random numbers in Java and how to integrate them into a larger workflow.

Possible applications in my professional life:
Development of data management applications:
The knowledge acquired in this project is essential to develop applications that handle large volumes
such as inventory management systems, accounting systems, and sales management systems.
Automation of data processing tasks: The ability to programmatically read and write files is
essential for automating repetitive tasks in professional environments, such as reporting,
data migration and systems integration.

Development of data analysis applications:

Experience in data manipulation and random data generation can be helpful in application development
of data analysis and simulation, where it is required to work with large data sets and perform complex calculations.

Difficulties during the development of the project:
Exception Handling: One of the challenges was understanding and properly handling exceptions that may arise during
reading and writing files, as well as during other input/output operations.

Code design and organization:
As the project grew, the need arose to organize the code more efficiently to keep it clear and easy to understand.

This involved decisions about the structure of the project, the division into classes and methods, and the management of dependencies between components.

Testing and debugging: Ensuring that the program works correctly in different scenarios and handling unexpected errors during
program execution were major challenges. This required extensive testing and effective debugging techniques.
to identify and solve problems.
